      "question": "Which of the following statements about ACID properties in DBMS is true?",
      "options": [
        "Atomicity ensures that all parts of a transaction are completed successfully or none at all.",
        "Consistency guarantees that transactions always leave the database in a fixed state, regardless of failures.",
        "Isolation ensures that transactions occur independently without interference.",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "ACID properties ensure reliability in databases. Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability work together to maintain data integrity."

      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which indexing technique is most efficient for large-scale range queries?",
      "options": [
        "Hash Indexing",
        "B-Tree Indexing",
        "Bitmap Indexing",
        "Linear Probing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "B-Tree indexing is widely used for database indexing due to its ability to efficiently handle range queries and maintain balanced tree properties."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A transaction schedule is said to be conflict-serializable if: ",
      "options": [
        "It is equivalent to a serial schedule after swapping non-conflicting operations.",
        "It ensures that all transactions are executed sequentially.",
        "It avoids deadlocks by enforcing a strict execution order.",
        "It guarantees higher performance compared to all other scheduling methods."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Conflict-serializability ensures that a schedule can be transformed into a serial schedule by swapping non-conflicting operations, maintaining transaction correctness."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which of the following anomaly occurs due to a violation of 3rd Normal Form (3NF)?",
      "options": [
        "Insertion Anomaly",
        "Deletion Anomaly",
        "Update Anomaly",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "3NF eliminates transitive dependencies, preventing insertion, deletion, and update anomalies. A violation leads to redundant data and inconsistencies."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which of the following is a key advantage of using multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases?",
      "options": [
        "It eliminates the need for locking mechanisms.",
        "It reduces transaction isolation overhead.",
        "It allows for simultaneous reads and writes without conflicts.",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "MVCC improves performance by allowing transactions to operate on different versions of data, reducing contention and ensuring consistency."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is the primary advantage of using a clustered index in a database?",
      "options": [
        "It speeds up DELETE operations.",
        "It ensures data is stored in sorted order, improving range queries.",
        "It allows multiple indexes per table.",
        "It reduces the size of the database."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A clustered index keeps data stored in sorted order, significantly improving the efficiency of range queries."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which SQL isolation level provides the highest level of data consistency but may lead to reduced concurrency?",
      "options": [
        "Read Uncommitted",
        "Read Committed",
        "Repeatable Read",
        "Serializable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The Serializable isolation level prevents all concurrency issues but restricts parallel transactions, leading to reduced performance."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the purpose of the WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mechanism in databases?",
      "options": [
        "To ensure changes are immediately committed to the database.",
        "To maintain a log of transactions for rollback and recovery.",
        "To improve indexing efficiency.",
        "To reduce disk storage requirements."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Write-Ahead Logging ensures that changes are first recorded in logs before applying them to the database, enabling rollback and recovery in case of failures."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which of the following is a primary cause of deadlocks in a DBMS?",
      "options": [
        "Too many concurrent transactions.",
        "Unordered resource acquisition.",
        "Excessive indexing.",
        "Poor query optimization."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Deadlocks occur when transactions acquire resources in an inconsistent order, leading to circular waits."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which algorithm is commonly used for query optimization in a DBMS?",
      "options": [
        "Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm",
        "Gradient Descent",
        "Cost-Based Optimization",
        "A* Search Algorithm"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Cost-Based Optimization (CBO) is widely used in query optimizers to determine the most efficient execution plan by evaluating different strategies."
